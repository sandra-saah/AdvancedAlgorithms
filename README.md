# AdvancedAlgorithms
1. Formulate problems as abstract models which can be solved by generic algorithms and
mathematical methods.
2. Critically evaluate, the effectiveness of the design, efficiency of the applications of
algorithms for processing data on a wide range of problems.
3. Execute and implement algorithms in a programming language.
